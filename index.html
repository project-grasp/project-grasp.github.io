<h2 id="what-is-project-grasp">What is Project GRASP?</h2>

<p><strong>Project GRASP</strong> is a Student Society located in the University of Glasgow that fosters student to unleash their potential and achieve or - how we prefer to say - <em>grasp</em> their dream and ambitions. We have a deep love for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects, in particular Mathematics and Computer Science, and want to spread it to the whole Scotland and, if possible, to the UK.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-do-are-you-different-from-other-tech-societies">What do you do? Are you different from other tech societies?</h2>

<p>Usually tech societies have a focus on engineering only, neglecting the fascinating world of Maths and Pure Computer Science. However the world as we know it has deep roots on the foundations of the Sciences. Just think of Machine Learning without Statistics, Cryptocurrencies without cryptography, Game Development without geometry and the SpaceX project without astrophysics.</p>

<p>Without diminishing the great value of Engineering, our aim is to unveil the underlying theoretical lattice of the world and find out that it isn&rsquo;t pretty theoretical all in all!</p>

<h2 id="who-can-take-part-to-grasp">Who can take part to GRASP?</h2>

<p>In a nutshell: Everybody!</p>

<p>If you are a high school student you may be interested in our courses on Olympiads (BIO, BMO and others coming soon).</p>

<p>If you are an undergradate student you may pop in to training for ACM ICPC contests (in the case, check out the ICPC 2019 link in the menu).</p>

<p>If you have an experience to share, just share it. We truly believe in giveback as a strong motivating factor: all in all it&rsquo;s our engine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Genius is 1% talent and 99% hard work

</blockquote>

<p>The talent misconception has always been a strong deterrent towards initiative. Many people believe they won&rsquo;t go any further because they lack of talent and thus stop working hard on their dreams. This is a catch 22, and we at GRASP want to stop it from happening on.</p>

<p>When you decide to join <strong>GRASP</strong>, either you are a student willing to learn something or a senior student/alumnus tutoring other people, you&rsquo;ll put a lot on effort on it. Even if you feel astonished because of people working restlessly next to you remember they have worked hard to achieve their level.</p>

<p>We at <strong>GRASP</strong> take this point seriously and it has become our mission.</p>

  <blockquote>
It is not just problems and concepts that were taught at project Grasp. We were also taught
how to think for ourselves and as a team; how to tackle problems where we had no idea
how and how to develop ourselves on our own as well. <br>

<blockquote>
The biggest impact of Project Grasp for me was that it helped me achieve an offer from
Oxford University to study Mathematics. Not only did I mention Grasp in my personal
statement, but the questions I faced there were similar to the ones that I had to answer as
part of the admissions exam to study at the university. When I was asked to an interview in
Oxford the questions I was asked were also quite similar to the questions faced at Grasp
and the fact that I had attempting these questions many times may have impressed the
interviewers enough to get me an offer to study there.

<blockquote>
My communication skills have definitely improved as working on the project in a group
required you to talk to other people and find out what tasks they were doing. Every morning
we would have a retrospective, where we talked about our successful tasks that we did or
issues we had with our tasks. We were very organised by making sure tasks are clear and
achievable, this would allow us to make full use of the two weeks and time was not wasted.

<h3 id="hurry-up-the-deadline-for-registration-is-on-17-sup-th-sup-october-2018">Hurry up! The deadline for registration is on 17<sup>th</sup> October 2018.</h3>

<p>If you:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>are an University undergraduate</strong></li>
<li><strong>are good at coding in Python / C++ / Java</strong></li>
<li><strong>want to get sharp in algorithms and Maths</strong></li>
<li><strong>desire to learn something any academy will never teach you</strong></li>
<li><strong>want to unleash your potential</strong></li>
<li><strong>feel competitive</strong></li>
<li><strong>just want to enjoy a stimulating field and have fun</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Then ICPC is good for you!</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-are-they">What are they?</h2>

<p>ICPC stands for <em>International Collegiate Programming Contest</em> and is an important worldwide coding competition that takes place
online and is open to the world. The opportunity is open to any undergraduate University across the world.</p>

<p>ICPC are probably the most famous <strong>Competitive Programming</strong> competition, alongside the <strong>International Olympiads in Informatics</strong> (IOI).</p>

<p>We at <strong>GRASP</strong> train teams that are expected to strike hard at the ICPC. What we miss is humans to train, so why not come forward?</p>

<h2 id="doubts">Doubts?</h2>

<p>Have a look on <a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/compete/faq">the ACM ICPC FAQ</a> for details about how the contest actually works.</p>

<h2 id="want-to-join">Want to join?</h2>

<p>Great! Here&rsquo;s the procedure.</p>

<ol>
<li>Find people who may want to be your dream team. Do you struggle to find them? Read the next section.</li>
<li>Once you found them, head to <a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu">https://icpc.baylor.edu</a> and press &ldquo;signup&rdquo; and register</li>
<li>Create a team (Choose Europe contests -&gt; &ldquo;The 2018 Northwestern Europe Regional Contest&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;The 2018 UK &amp; Ireland Programming Contest&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;University of Glasgow&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Add your teammates details, and your coach will accept your team.</li>
</ol>

<p>The registered coach is Adam Kurkiewicz (<a href="mailto:adam@kurkiewicz.pl">adam@kurkiewicz.pl</a> so contact him in case you struggle.</p>

<p>All the students who join will be trained by Adam, the author of this post (Enrico Trombetta, <a href="mailto:trombetta.enricom@pm.me">trombetta.enricom@pm.me</a>) and probably even more skillful people. Remember, the more we are, the better!</p>

<h2 id="struggling-to-find-a-team">Struggling to find a team?</h2>

<p>Don&rsquo;t feel ashamed. It&rsquo;s quite difficult to find motivated people during the lectures. On that case, just contact us directly (use the email given above or the contact link on the menu).</p>
